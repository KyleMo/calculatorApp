# Calculator App
An app that functions as a basic calculator. Technology used includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The biggest challenges I faced was ensuring the behaviour of the calculator functioned as intended. Example include:
  - What happens when "2", then "*", then "=" is inputed.
  - What happens when "*", then "2", then "=" is inputed.
  - Ensure values are properly reassigned and set to continue one operations.

Admitedly, my first iteration addressed these issues in a very clunky and hard way to understand from a logic perspective.

Admittedly, my first iteration addressed these issues in a very clunky and hard to understand manner. My second iteration used functions to simplify operation and make understanding the code easier.
