# Calculator App
An app that functions as a basic calculator. Technology used includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The biggest challenge I faced was ensuring the behavior of the calculator functioned as intended. Examples include:
  - What happens when "2", then "*", then "=" is input.
  - What happens when "*", then "2", then "=" is input.
  - Ensure values are properly reassigned and set to continue one operation.

Admittedly, my first iteration addressed these issues in a very clunky and hard to understand manner. My second iteration used functions to simplify operation and make understanding the code easier.
